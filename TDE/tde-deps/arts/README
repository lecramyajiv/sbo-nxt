aRts is a short form for "analog realtime synthesizer".
aRts is highly modular, creating and processing sound using small
modules performing specific tasks.These may create a waveform
play samples, filter data, add signals, perform effects like
delay/flanger/chorus, or output the data to the soundcard.
