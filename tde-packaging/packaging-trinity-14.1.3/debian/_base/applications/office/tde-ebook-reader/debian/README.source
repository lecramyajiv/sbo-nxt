This Debian package for tde-ebook-reader does not contain some of the original
FBReader hyphenation patterns due to following license problems:

el.pattern: no license
fi.pattern: modification is not explicitly allowed
tr.pattern: no license

These files were removed from zlibrary/text/data/hyphenationPatterns.zip.
