fbreader (0.10.7dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, some changes:
    - 0.10.7:
      - A conflict between hyperlink clicks and touch scrolling has
        been fixed.
      - In maemo versions, empty menu items have been hidden.
    - 0.10.6:
      - A bug with images/css links in epub has been fixed. All the links
        inside XHTML files were interpreted relative to the root OPF location
        instead of XHTML file location. As a result, some images were not shown
        in epub books.
    - 0.10.5:
      - The migration tool from version 0.8.* has been fixed. After an upgrade
        from 0.8.* to this version, the first opening of your library will take
        some time.
      - A freeze (on some PDB books with more than one page and images, and
        using small font size) has been fixed.
      - Several text selection related issues have been fixed.
    - 0.10.4:
      - Maemo support is back.
      - Multiple fixes in the epub format support.
  * debian/control:
    - Re-introduced libzlui-maemo binary package.
    - Different minor versions of the same ui packages ('libzlui-*') are
      incompatible between each other but have the same name, and it can cause
      problems on upgrades. This is not a reliable behavior, so now
      'libzlui-*' packages don't provide 'libzlui' virtual package anymore.
      Binary package 'fbreader' now strictly depends on same or newer binary
      versions of one of 'libzlui-*' packages. (Closes: #521136)
    - Bumped 'Standards-Version' to 3.8.1, no changes needed.
  * debian/rules:
    - Uncommented building maemo binaries.
  * debian/dfsg-repack:
    - Corrected to output usage when the parameter is not given.
  * debian/patches:
    - 005-maemo-makefile.patch: refreshed.
    - New 020-maemo-disable-libconic.patch: disable libconic-related parts of
      the maemo UI. Libconic depends on closed source, not even available
      software.
    - New 200-maemo-gtkentryparameter.patch: remove tuning-only hildon calls
      that Debian GTK+ libraries cannot (yet?) satisfy.
    - 930-use-shell-make-variable.patch: refreshed.
    - debian/patches/940-use-debian-compiler-flags.patch: refreshed.

    - Added {misc:Depends} to Depends of all packages, fixing lintian

    - Removed duplicated 'Priority' fields from binary packages' entries.
    - Divided architecture-independent data from package libzltext0.10 to its
