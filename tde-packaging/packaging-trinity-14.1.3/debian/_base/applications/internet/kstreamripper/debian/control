Description: TDE frontend for streamripper
 KStreamRipper is a small frontend for the streamripper command 
 line utility. Streamripper captures internet shoutcast radio streams 
 on your harddisk and splits them up in mp3 files. KStreamRipper helps 
 you with managing/ripping your preferred streams.
