Description: a Quake-style terminal emulator based on TDE Konsole technology [Trinity]
 YaKuake is inspired from the terminal in the Quake game: when you press a key 
 (by default F12, but that can be changed) a terminal window slides down from 
 the top of the screen. Press the key again, and the terminal slides back. 
 .
 It is faster than a keyboard shortcut because it is already loaded into memory 
 and as such is very useful to anyone who frequently finds themselves switching 
 in and out of terminal sessions.
