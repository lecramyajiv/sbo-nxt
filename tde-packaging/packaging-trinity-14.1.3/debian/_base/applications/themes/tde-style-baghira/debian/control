 Based upon mosfet-liquid0.9.6pre4... the last heir of mosfet.
 Baghira includes both an style (custom widgets) and twin decoration as
 well as colour schemes.

 Baghira (panther, in german) makes TDE resemble Apple's MacOS X's Aqua,
 Panther and Jaguar looks, and also includes its own 'Baghira' look
