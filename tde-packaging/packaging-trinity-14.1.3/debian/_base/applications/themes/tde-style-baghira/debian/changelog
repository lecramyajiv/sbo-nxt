baghira (0.6f-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    - Upstream removed all icons whose license was unclear and 
      replaced them with his original artwork [along with the SVG source,
      so this won't even be an issue with Etch] (Closes: #298294)
      (urgency->medium)
    - Backported to KDE3.3 with assistance from upstream, so that it can
      compile and run with current "testing" packages.

  * Build enhancements:
    - removed "strip" options in debian/rules; just dh_strip is enough.
