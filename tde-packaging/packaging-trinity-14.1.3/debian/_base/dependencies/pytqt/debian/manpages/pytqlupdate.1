.SH NAME
pytqlupdate \- update TQt Linguist translation files from Python sources
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pytqlupdate
.RI "[ " options " ] " project-file...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This page documents the
.B TQt Linguist Update
tool for the TQt GUI toolkit, for Python source files.
.B PyTQLupdate
reads a tqmake project file (.pro file), finds the translatable
strings in the specified source, header and interface files, and
updates the translation files (.ts files) specified in it. The
translation files are given to the translator who uses
.B TQt Linguist
to read the files and insert the translations.
.PP
The .ts file format is a simple human-readable XML format that can be
used with version control systems if required.

.nf
SOURCES         = funnydialog.py \\
                  main.py \\
                  wackywidget.py
FORMS           = fancybox.ui
TRANSLATIONS    = gnomovision_dk.ts \\
                  gnomovision_fi.ts \\
                  gnomovision_no.ts \\
                  gnomovision_se.ts

When running
.B pytqlupdate
on this project file, the translatable strings in all the files
listed in the SOURCES and FORMS entries will be put in
the translation files listed in the TRANSLATIONS entry. Previous
translations will be reused as far as possible, and translated
strings that have vanished from the source files are marked obsolete.
