Description: Library of functions for 2D graphics - runtime files
 A library of functions for 2D graphics supporting a superset of the
 PostScript imaging model, designed to be integrated with graphics, artwork,
 and illustration programs. It is written in optimized C, and is fully
 compatible with C++. With a small footprint of 10,000 lines of code, it is
 especially suitable for embedded applications.
